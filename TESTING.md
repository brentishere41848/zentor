# Avorax Testing

This file documents the test and build checks used for the Avorax hardening sprint.

## Toolchain notes

On this Windows development machine, Flutter is installed at:

```text
C:\Users\Brent\dev\flutter\bin
```

From Git Bash, prefer explicit `.bat` invocations:

```bash
'/c/Users/Brent/dev/flutter/bin/flutter.bat' analyze
'/c/Users/Brent/dev/flutter/bin/flutter.bat' test
'/c/Users/Brent/dev/flutter/bin/dart.bat' test
```

## Flutter client

```bash
cd apps/zentor_client
'/c/Users/Brent/dev/flutter/bin/flutter.bat' analyze
'/c/Users/Brent/dev/flutter/bin/flutter.bat' test
'/c/Users/Brent/dev/flutter/bin/flutter.bat' build windows --debug
```

Current coverage includes API failure handling, startup smoke tests, app detection empty states, scan target planning, offline scan orchestration, stale error clearing, local event log corruption recovery, navigation semantics, shell page-title/main-content accessibility semantics, and Settings section-heading semantics.

## Rust local core

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path core/zentor_local_core/Cargo.toml
```

Current coverage includes file walking, heuristic detection, YARA-style rule behavior, AI/model safety gates, allowlist validation, quarantine metadata/restore/delete safety, guard mode configuration, ransomware guard simulation, and scan job cancellation primitives.

## Rust guard service

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path core/zentor_guard_service/Cargo.toml
```

Current coverage includes configured guard modes, driver IPC verdict behavior, known-good/known-bad handling, lockdown behavior, mock process monitoring, cached native-engine reuse for pre-execution verdicts, and streaming guard-file hashing.

Focused driver/guard contract checks can be run with:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_custom_driver_contract.py -q
cargo test --manifest-path core/zentor_guard_service/Cargo.toml driver_ipc -- --nocapture
```

## Rust native engine

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path core/zentor_native_engine/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path core/zentor_native_engine/Cargo.toml provider -- --nocapture
```

Current coverage includes native signatures, deterministic rules, heuristics, development-model safety, threat-intel pack import, streaming large-file metadata, quarantine copy fallback, behavior/ransomware windows, and detection-provider registry/status behavior.

Known environment limitation: Microsoft Defender may block the native-engine test executable with Windows error 225 because antivirus test fixtures intentionally resemble malware signatures. That is an environment/security-tool block, not a successful test run. Re-run in a trusted development folder or with an explicit developer exclusion only if appropriate.

## Dart protocol package

```bash
cd packages/zentor_protocol
'/c/Users/Brent/dev/flutter/bin/dart.bat' test

cd ../avorax_protocol
'/c/Users/Brent/dev/flutter/bin/dart.bat' analyze
'/c/Users/Brent/dev/flutter/bin/dart.bat' test
```

`packages/avorax_protocol` covers shared update manifest parsing/defaults/serialization for `.aup` verifier and app compatibility.

## Release/build gates

Run these before tagging or shipping an installer when the required Windows/PowerShell environment is available:

```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/branding/branding-check.ps1
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/security/zentor-product-copy-gate.ps1
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/security/zentor-no-malware-binaries-gate.ps1 -RepoRoot .
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/security/zentor-false-positive-gate.ps1
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/security/zentor-protection-gate.ps1 -RepoRoot . -SelfTestReport <selftest_report.json>
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/perf/zentor-performance-gate.ps1 -RepoRoot .
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/windows/zentor-release-gate.ps1
```

The performance gate also runs `tools/perf/avorax-benchmark.py`, which writes `dist/performance/benchmark_report.json`. The harness uses harmless synthetic files, existing Rust test commands, and a non-elevated update-copy simulation. It is useful for trend tracking but does not replace signed-driver latency tests or elevated update-service apply benchmarks.

CI now runs the product-copy, no-malware-binaries, false-positive, protection, and performance gates. The CI protection gate uses a synthetic non-driver self-test fixture and does not claim kernel driver validation; driver-feature release gates still require a real signed/installed/self-tested driver report.

Some service/driver/update gates may require elevation or a signed installed driver. If they cannot run, document the blocker in `RUN_LOG.md` and do not claim the gated capability as verified.

Current Windows limitation: `cargo test --manifest-path core/avorax_update_service/Cargo.toml` and `--bin avorax_update_service` can fail before running tests with Windows error 740 because the update-service test binaries inherit a require-administrator manifest. In a non-elevated shell, use `cargo check --manifest-path core/avorax_update_service/Cargo.toml --bin avorax_update_service` plus `uv run pytest tests/test_custom_driver_contract.py -q`, or rerun the Rust unit tests from an elevated developer shell. The static contract test also checks that update apply attempts rollback restoration and service restart on payload-copy failure; elevated integration tests are still needed for real service stop/start/apply paths.
