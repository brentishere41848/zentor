# Windows Driver

True Windows pre-execution/on-access blocking requires a signed kernel minifilter and process guard path.

Current implementation:

- User-mode Zentor Guard Service can stop confirmed threats after launch.
- `core/zentor_windows_minifilter` contains a WDK minifilter project with Filter Manager communication-port code and conservative deny policy hooks.
- `core/zentor_windows_process_guard` contains a process notification driver project that establishes the callback path but does not claim deny/blocking until a verified signed-driver cache is implemented.
- The UI must show `Driver Missing` or `Post-launch blocking active` unless a signed driver is installed and verified running.

Driver requirements:

- Use documented Microsoft Filter Manager and process notification APIs.
- Communicate with the visible Zentor Guard Service.
- Avoid recursive scanning of Zentor quarantine and Zentor binaries.
- Fail open for critical system paths in normal mode.
- Never hide files, processes, services, registry keys, or telemetry.
- Never disable Windows Defender or other security products.

Development install scripts live in `core/zentor_windows_minifilter/scripts`. They require Administrator rights and Windows TESTSIGNING to already be enabled in a development VM. Zentor does not enable TESTSIGNING automatically.

Validation workflow:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\windows\zentor-protection-selftest.ps1 -BuildDriver -InstallDriver
```

In v0.1.13, Lockdown Mode adds unknown-app block verdicts to the Guard policy. The UI may only show pre-execution Lockdown blocking when the self-test confirms:

- Driver loaded.
- Driver IPC OK.
- Known-bad executable blocked before launch.
- Unknown unsigned executable blocked before launch in Lockdown.
- Known-good executable allowed.
- Exact-hash approval allows the same unknown executable.

The workflow writes `dist\windows-driver-validation\selftest_report.json`. Driver-enabled release gates must fail if this report is missing or failing.
