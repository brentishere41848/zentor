 * Zentor Windows Minifilter skeleton.

 * a VM, and signed through the correct Microsoft driver-signing path.
 *
 * Architecture follows the public Microsoft minifilter model:
 * - register callbacks with Filter Manager
 * - send user-mode scan requests to Zentor Guard Service
 * - deny only confirmed malicious verdicts within explicit timeout policy
 * - fail open for critical system paths in normal mode
